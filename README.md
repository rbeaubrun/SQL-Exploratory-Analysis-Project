# Global Health Data Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview  
This project involves leveraging SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data dataset. Spanning from 2020 to 2023, the analysis explores key relationships between infections, vaccinations, and deaths across five major continents. 

The project also includes the design of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends and regional impacts, helping to generate insights that can inform global health strategies and pandemic response.

## Key Tasks  
- **SQL EDA**:  
  Using SQL, I conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data, investigating the relationships between key variables such as infection rates, vaccination coverage, and death tolls.
  
- **Power BI Dashboard**:  
  I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI, visualizing infection trends and vaccination impacts across five continents. The dashboard allows for both regional and temporal insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

- **Insights & Reporting**:  
  The analysis generated actionable insights into the global health landscape, which could be utilized to inform pandemic response strategies and improve understanding of COVID-19's long-term impacts.

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL**: Data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI**: Interactive data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Our World in Data**: COVID-19 dataset (2020â€“2023)

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the power of SQL and Power BI in conducting meaningful analyses and creating dynamic visualizations, providing insights into the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
